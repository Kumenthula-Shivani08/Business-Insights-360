AtliQ Hardware sells electronics like PCs, mouse, and printers in many countries. They use Excel to track their data, but it's slow, has errors, and doesnâ€™t give clear insights. As the company grows, this makes it hard to make good decisions. This has led to losses in places like Latin America. AtliQ needs a better way to use their data and make smarter decisions.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware sells electronics like PCs, mouse, and printers in many countries. They use Excel to track their data, but it's slow, has errors, and doesn‚Äôt give clear insights. As the company grows, this makes it hard to make good decisions. This has led to losses in places like Latin America. AtliQ needs a better way to use their data and make smarter decisions.
